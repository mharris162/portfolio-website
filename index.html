            <h2 class="info">Hello!</h2>
            <p class="info">I’m MacKenzie Harris, a passionate web designer and developer with 1 year of experience creating visually appealing and highly functional websites. I specialize in using Figma and Adobe XD to design user-friendly interfaces and bringing those designs to life with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have hands-on experience building dynamic, customizable websites using WordPress and its versatile plug-ins.
                In addition to web design and development, I have 1 year of experience in graphic design and interactive media, utilizing tools from the Adobe Creative Cloud to craft compelling visuals and engaging content.
                When I’m not immersed in designing or coding, you’ll likely find me at a concert, on my yoga mat, or enjoying a great movie. These hobbies inspire my creativity and fuel my passion for creating meaningful digital experiences.
